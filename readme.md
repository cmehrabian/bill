# Following the money trail 

We built a web app where users can see what companies contributed to what candidates, and also what candidates voted on per specific bill.

Visualize data about campaign finance, and how your senators are engaging with legislature. Our goal is to make it easier to become an informed voter by giving people the impartial resources to develop their own opinions about policy.

Access past legislature that has made the rounds through the House and Senate or pending legislature for discussion. Information about the bill and its added earmarks will be included alongside graphs to provide better context.
